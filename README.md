```
yarn global add graphql-up

graphql-up note.graphql
```

After endpoint was created, you will receive this message:
```
  ‚úî  Your GraphQL API is ready to use. Here are your endpoints:

    ‚ùØ Simple API: https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__path__
    ‚ùØ Relay API:  https://api.graph.cool/relay/v1/__path__


  Open your GraphQL endpoint in a browser to use the interactive API Playground.

  API Documentation: https://www.graph.cool/docs/graphql-up/
```
At `index.js`, copy your `Simple API` and paste into `uri` key in `new Link({ uri: ... })`
```
new Link({
  uri: 'https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__path__',
}),
```
And you must manually fill web socket path into `uri` key in `new WebSocketLink({ uri: ... })`
```
new WebSocketLink({
  uri: 'wss://subscriptions.graph.cool/v1/__path__',
  options: { reconnect: true },
}),
```

Open `Simple API` link on the browser to access Playground
